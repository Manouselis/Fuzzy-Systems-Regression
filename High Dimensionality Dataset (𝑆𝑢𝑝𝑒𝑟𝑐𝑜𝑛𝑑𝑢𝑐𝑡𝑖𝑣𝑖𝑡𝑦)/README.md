### High Dimensionality Dataset ###

Dataset with :
* 81 characteristics 
* 21263 samples

The goal is to find the best model parameters. Because of the dimensionality of the dataset, the techniques used at the first dataset can't be applied here. Through the use of the Relief algorithm we select the most important characteristics of our Dataset. To find the best pair for Cluster Radius (Subtractive Clustering) and Number Of Features , a parametric analysis (GridSearch) was performed, based on a 5-fold Cross-Validation.
