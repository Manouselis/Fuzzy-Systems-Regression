### High Dimensionality Dataset ###

The goal is to find the best model parameters to classify the samples of the  dataset. Because of the dimensionality of the dataset, the techniques used at Task 1 can't be applied here. Through the use of the Relief algorithm we select the most important characteristics of our Dataset. To find the best pair for Cluster Radius and Number Of Features , a parametric analysis (GridSearch) was performed, based on a 5-fold Cross-Validation.
