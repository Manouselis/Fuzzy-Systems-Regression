# Fuzzy Systems Regression

Create fuzzy TSK models for samples of multivariable, nonlinear functions.

Datasets used:

      Dataset 1: 𝐴𝑖𝑟𝑓𝑜𝑖𝑙 𝑆𝑒𝑙𝑓−𝑁𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒 𝐷𝑎𝑡𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑡

      Dataset 2: 𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑡


This is an experimental application developed as part of the course "Fuzzy Systems" assignment, that took place in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 2020.

The first dataset [D 1] will be used for a simple exploration of the training process and evaluation of such models and demonstrating ways of analyzing and interpreting the results. The second and more complex dataset [D 2] will be used for a more complete modeling process, which includes preprocessing steps, such as Features Selection, as well as methods for model optimization through cross validation.
