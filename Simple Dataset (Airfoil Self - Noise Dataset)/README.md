# Simple Dataset #
After splitting the Dataset to a subset of:
* Training Data (20% of original Dataset)
* Check Data (20% of original Dataset)
* Test Data (20% of original Dataset)

The goal is to find the best model parameters.

* Task Model 1
    * Epochs = 100 
    * Singleton Output.
    * 2 membership functions

* Task Model 2 
    * Epochs = 100 
    * Singleton Output
    * 3 membership functions

* Task Model 3 
    * Epochs = 60 
    * Polynomial Output
    * 2 membership functions

* Task Model 4 
    * Epochs = 60 
    * Polynomial Output
    * 3 membership functions
